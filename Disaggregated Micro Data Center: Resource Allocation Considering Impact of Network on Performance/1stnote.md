## Abstract 

### Questions?

· What is micro data center? I mean the difference from normal data center.

· what is resource allocation method?

### methods:

1.model the impact f the allocated resources on the performance of the apps.

2. allow multiple alls to share links when all the processes are completed (or to be) within acceptable time.

3. To accommodate more apps, if candidate resources exist, avoids allocating what will be requested by apps in the future

Finally, evaluate method


## 2

### Questions

· pages transmitted per page fault:  the average number of pages that need to be read from or written to the secondary storage (like a hard disk or SSD) each time a page fault occurs.1

## Conclusion

### Summarize:

1. Model the impact of allocated resources

2. Allow multiple apps to share links under some condition

3. Preserves important resources

4. evaluate RA-CNP by simulating allocation of continually generated resource requests and demonstrated that it can accommodate more apps

### Future Work

1. Future investigate the structure of a uDDC from network topology and the location of resources, and to consider the resource allocation with in it.

2. 

### Q

1. What is RA-CNP?
