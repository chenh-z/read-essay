# A Survey on End-Edge-Cloud Orchestrated Network Computing Paradigms： Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet
## Abstract
In IoT era, it's difficult to satisfy delay sensitive and context awareness of IoT applications. Recently years, facing this challenge, serval new computing paradigms have emerged,  which form a new hierarchical architecture： End-Edge-Cloud architecture to improve the efficiency of IoT. This article compares the feature and architecture of four computing, and survey the latest research in computing loading, cache, security, and privacy. In the end, some potential research directions have been overlooked.
## 2 Emerging Computing 
## 7 Conclusion
