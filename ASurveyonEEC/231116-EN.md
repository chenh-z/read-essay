# A Survey on End-Edge-Cloud Orchestrated Network Computing Paradigms： Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet
## Abstract
In IoT era, it's difficult to satisfy delay sensitive and context awareness of IoT applications. Recently years, facing this challenge, serval new computing paradigms have emerged,  which form a new hierarchical architecture： End-Edge-Cloud architecture to improve the efficiency of IoT. This article compares the feature and architecture of four computing, and survey the latest research in computing loading, cache, security, and privacy. In the end, some potential research directions have been overlooked.
## 2 Emerging Computing Paradigm and Evaluation Criterions
Having an introduction on four computing paradigms: Transparent Computing(TC), Fog Computing(Fog), Mobile Edge Computing(MEC) and Cloudlet.
### 2.1 Transparent Computing(TC)
A computing paradigm which provide serives directly without make the users feel the details of the services
3 Comcept:
· Client-server mode: Servers storage software and data of users, client divice request instruction and data from servers through network.
·Division of software and hardware: Instead of client devices, it's servers storage software, OS and so on.
·Block-stream Service: Enable client device get services on demand, and just load the code block realted to this service.
## 2.2 Mobile Edge Computing(MEC)


## 7 Conclusion
